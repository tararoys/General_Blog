Imagine that you want to get to the top of a fifty-foot cliff, so you start climbing.  What happens if you make a mistake?  You fall off the cliff.  This is not a problem when you are three feet off the ground.  This is a big problem when you are thirty feet off the ground.  Every inch you climb makes it more dangerous to make a mistake.  

This has a couple of consequences.  Most people, looking at the cliff, will decide they don't want to die, and choose not to climb it.  Some people will only climb three feet up, so that if they fall it won't be too far.  Only very experienced climbers will climb all the way to the top.  The rest are too afraid that they will break something if they try it.  

Then someone invents the climbing rope. The climbing rope works like this:  a climber ties a rope around their waist, and climbs a little bit up the cliff. After they are about ten feet off the ground, the climber puts a bolt into the cliff face and ties the rope to the bolt.  Now, if they fall, the rope will catch the climber and leave them swinging from the bolt instead of falling all the way to the ground.  The climber then climbs a little bit further up the cliff, puts in another bolt, and ties the rope off again.  By using a rope and bolts, a good climber will never have to fall more than ten feet- which is much, much better than falling all the way to the ground. 

What happens then?  People who used to be afraid of falling will start climbing the cliff, secure in the knowledge that if they do fall, they won't fall that far.  Many, many, many more peopel climb the cliff, and most of them make it to the top. Rock climbing becomes a popular sport instead of being restricted to a few expert daredevils.    

Writing a program is like climbing the cliff. Every line you write makes your program more complex.  The more lines you write, the more you're afraid that you will make a mistake that breaks the whole program, and leaves you unable to fix it, much like a small mistake will leave a climber plunging to their death.  But what if you had a rope?

Version control is your rope that is bolted to the cliffside.  Every time you add a few lines of working code, you save your work into a new version.  That version is like your latest bolt in the cliffside.  Even if you add a bunch of non-working code and totally mess up your program, you can still delete it all and go back to your last version, just like when if you're rock climbing, you can let go of the cliff and you won't fall further than your last bolt. 

There are other advantages as well.  As a climber, you can look back and a see a line of all your previous bolts in the cliffside.  If you wanted to, you could climb back down to any of them and start climbing in a new direction.  That is exactly the same advantage version control gives you: since you've been saving versions of your code all along, you can go back to one of the previous versions and start working from there.

What is version control?  Version control is your safety line.  A rope lets a climber make mistakes without dying, and version control lets a programmer make mistakes without destroying his entire program.  

Now that you know what version control is, I hope it's a no-brainer about why you should use it.  After all, would you go rock-climbing without a rope?
