### About Tara's Blog

 I'm Tara Roys, and I'm a hacker, developer, and all-around geeky girl.  I like coding, I like telling stories, and I hate 99% of technical documentation.  As a beginner, when I ask the question ["What is version control, and why should I care?"](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) I would rather hear ["Coding is like climbing a cliff and version control is your safety rope."](what-is-version-control) than ["Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later."](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)
