Yoda was full of it when he told Luke not to fear.   "Anger, fear, aggressionâ€¦the dark side are they."  This is all true.  But where the pint-sized philosopher goes off the rails is by treating 'The Dark Side" like it's a bad thing.  

Yoda thinks I should not feel fear.  Do you know how incredibly difficult it is to not feel an emotion?  Anyone who's fought with themselves knows that minds have at least two parts:  the thinking bit, the bit that keeps track of your homework, and the feeling bit, that likes to eat, sleep, screw, and is responsible for all of our lovely emotions.  It's like a rider and a horse.  The thinking bit is like a rider:  small, weird-looking, and yet somehow has managed to convince this giant, powerful horse that it's a good idea to do what she wants. 
 
Ladies and gentlemen, what Yoda is advising here is that you take your horse out and shoot it.   Yoda, honestly.  You want to make me walk everywhere when I could be out Lone-Rangering it up on a horse?  

I think someone got mad at Yoda once, and yelled at him, and he felt so bad that he decided that half of your emotions are terrible things and that you should not feel angry or sad or scared no matter what.  It's like nobody ever mentioned to him that emotions are like tools, and it's how you use them that determines if they're good or evil.  This wouldn't matter so much if he just stayed and moldered in his swamp, but now he's telling  Luke that he's a pathetic loser who will destroy the whole galaxy because he's feeling scared and angry.

News flash: being scared and angry is perfectly normal.  You have every right in the world to be scared and angry. In fact, being scared and angry gives you energy.  You have loads more horsepower when you're scared and angry.   Right now I'm angry that I spent years listening to the Yodas of the world and trying to shoot my horse when I could have been galloping around like a champ.  

In fact, the day I learned to use my anger for good was the day my life changed dramatically for the better.  Let me show you the moment of revelation:  

I was in my messy room.  I was in a bad mood because my room was messy.  Here is my thought process.  

"Look at this room.  It is a mess.  A Jedi should not be so messy.  Are you feeling angry that it's messy?  Anger is bad. You shouldn't feel anger. Stop feeling anger!  There, now you're feeling bad.  You should feel bad that you felt angry, because anger is bad.  Now sit on your bed and feel bad and eat yogurt and drop the container on the floor and make your room messier."  

This particular thought process is less than helpful. Now let's see what happened when I told Yoda to stuff it.  

"Look at this room.  It's a mess.  A Jedi should not be so messy. Are feeling angry?" At this point, I let the anger do the talking. "Yes, you poisonous little voice.  I'm feeling angry!  Now you're going to tell me that anger is bad.  You know what I hate?  People who tell me how I ought to feel while telling me what to do.  Maybe I don't have twenty years cleaning experience.  Maybe I've never mopped before, and I'm feeling overwhelmed.  Now, instead of telling me to do just one thing at a time, you're telling me to do two things: clean AND control my feelings.  Telling me that my feelings are bad is taking away the one damned thing giving me the energy to do shit right now!  Screw you!  I'm angry, I've got power, and I'm going to clean, and I'm going to do it pissed off, because then the room will get CLEAN!" 

And lo, the room was cleaned.
