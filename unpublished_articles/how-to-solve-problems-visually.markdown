Solving Problems Visually
===============================================

Design
============

The short answer is read (Napkin) book.  


Heirarchy: The order in which the user views content.  
Consistency:  make sure things are in the same place every time. 
Design is about communication.  

Glassblowing, pottery, and jewelry are not intended to communicate 
an idea.  

Communication is not the primary focus of fine art.  

Design is "How well do I talk to a reader?" It is about communicating visually?
Why should we communicate with images?  Because a picture is worth a thousand words.
Words are more specific.  Images are fast and memorable- you can pick them out in 
the crowd.  

How do you solve problems visually and memorablly? 

Here is a formula.  
Simple drawings can communicate.  

Let's talk about problems?  Everything is problems.  

here is a process of visual thinking?

1. Who & 
2. what: people
2. How much: Measurment and quanityt
3. When: scheduling
4. How: driection, seeing 
5. Why:  Seeing big picture

Using images to talk about problems is more effective than thinking and writing about them.
Why should you use drawings to talk about problems?  Because drawing is fast.  You need a pencil
and paper.  By drawing something, you articulate a previously vague idea in your mind. You will
clarify everything you know if you are forced to draw it out bit by bit.  

You don't need special skills to draw. You could use a stick and sand. 

It increases communication.  When there is somthing in front of you, you can talk about it even if you
didn't create it.  If you draw something while people watch, they can ask questions.  

Travel by teleportation vs travel by walking.  You got there step-by-step. Teleportation overwhelms you.

Use drawings to include people who otherwise wouldn't be included.  It is most effective when there are 
perceived to be no wrong ideas. People are more likely to contribute.

Drawings are less intimidating than more professionsal images.  It is a lot easier to talk about a sketch
that people don't perceive as valuable.  Finished images people talk about details.  If you present them 
with a sketch, they'll talk about more basic ideas.

Drawings are quick to create and easy to change. You don't have to stick to the original thing.  Drawing 
is MUCH faster than images on a computer. It allows you to iterate faster. 

Look->see -> imagine-> show

You can go back to any previous step.

Looking is the first step in a visual process. In order to see what a person looks like, you have to look
at them.  

If you intend to draw a thing in front of you, you need to spend most of your time looking at it. You notice
Orientation , position (where), identification(what is it?), direction (Animation) .  

How do we use ability to look to solve problems?  Collect everything you can.  

Lay it all out where you can look at it.  When you get everything in the same place, you get a different 
perspective.  Lay it all out.  

Practice visual triage.  Bombarded with massive amounts of sensory info.  Our brains know which things are important and which are not. 
You recognize this precognitively.  

Exercize:  Look at the images.  List things you notice about it. 

Looking: passive collection.
Seeing is taking information and forming relationships about it. 

Seeing: recognize a pattern.  

In the looking step, there are ways that you automatically look.  The four looking types can be mapped to problem type.  Who&What are idenitfication. 
Different pathwasy account for different ways of seeing.   How many animals are on this side?  

An example of looking:  The part of the image in the center is most finished.  The part of the image that is finished is
the part that the image wants to look at. 

Looking is pattern recognition. How something is made. How much time.  Seeing is relating.  

We don't spend months or years creating a painting.  The process of image-making is not something we think about.  Mortality of painting. 
What is socially acceptable in terms of making images?  The amount of information you can get out of images?  The more backround
informaiton you know, the more you can 'see.'
